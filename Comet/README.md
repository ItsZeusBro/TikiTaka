# Comet
## A Comet is a "Comment/log" that gets produced when you extend JS classes with Comet

### Just use this.comet("whoa") in your class
The way i use it. Instead of console.log()s and comments in my code, i just use a descriptive comet that serves both purposes.

WARNING: Please don't use yet. Needs testing
