# TikiTaka
## Playing Spanish Football with Files and Data
### Basic Terminology
The whole process of using Tiki Taka is called a "play"
By "ball" we mean data
By "pass" we mean passing ball down a path (directory) and to stop at the intended location (file)
By "defender" we mean the file guard that prevents us from overwriting it
By "chip pass" we mean "pass over" or "write over" the defender
By "touch" we mean setting up a location for the ball to stop at (file location)
By "touch touch" we mean take an extra touch to create the path for the play, and then its location
By "fake pass" we mean take the file data, put into buffer, delete the origin
By "dribble" we mean to set up a "read stream"
By "dribbleLongPass" we mean to set up a "read stream to write stream"
By "shoot" we mean to set up a socket or ipc for the data to shoot through
By "goal" it means we've succeeded on the difficult shot
