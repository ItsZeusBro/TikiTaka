- By "ball" we mean data

- By "blindPass" we mean pass without looking to see if the recipient (file) is there (only do this if confident)
- By "defender" we mean the file guard that prevents us from overwriting it
- By "chipPass" we mean "pass over" or "write over" the defender while checking to see if the file exists
- By "rabona" is a blind chip pass, we mean "pass over" or "write over" the defender without checking to see if the file exists (only do this if really confident)
- By "touch" we mean setting up a location for the ball to stop at (file location)
- By "touch touch" we mean take an extra touch to create the path for the play, and then its location
- By "fake pass" we mean take the file data, put into buffer, delete the origin
