# TikiTaka
WARNINGS: 
1. Please do not invest time in the names of these functions yet, as they are subject to change. Its too early. It's just to give you an idea.
2. TikiTaka takes an "Offensive Programming" style. Meaning, a lot of safeguards are removed in an otherwise defensive programming world. This also means we don't return feedback from functions to let you know if your move succeeds. This is designed to enforce player performance and sport like behavior.
3. TikiTaka is a sport first and foremost. However, we think (with time) you might end up more productive when you get really good at it.


## Playing Spanish Futbol with Files and Data
- Tiki Taka is a Spanish Football Style that is dynamic and unpredictable
characterized by small pelota touches in small spaces, with hard to reason about
passes.

It requires that the player with the ball successfully kicks the ball in the direction of the  intended recipient and that the recipient successfully receives the ball in stride so they can do something with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |      |

This can be done when the recipient (or goal) is behind you, or when the recipient will be behind you when the ball  reaches the intended position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |      |

A high cross is a pass that is lifted up in the air over defenders to reach the intended recipient in stride (typically while on their way towards the net, but not always). This is not the same as a chip pass, even though they can achieve the same result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |      |

A low cross is a pass that skips slightly above the ground with a large amount of force and speed. This is a good pass when the opportunity presents itself because it catches defenders off guard when they expect a high cross.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |      |

You fool defenders by looking one way and passing (or shooting) the ball the other way. This is typically done as a ground pass or shot. (Sometimes as a no  look chip pass or shot)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |      |

While you are turned from the ball and the ball is coming at you with speed (waist high), you can thrust your tuchus into the ball and deliver an unexpected  pass or shot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |      |

Typically you would do this to  lift the ball off the ground at short distances to keep defenders from being able to intercept the pass with a high kick. If it's a shot on goal, it is used to take advantage of an aggressive goal keeper that charges the ball carrier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |      |

At  high speeds dribbling towards a defender you can throw them off balance one way or the other allowing you to make a decisive move.

You take your foot outside of the ball and push it  opposite the side and wrap the ball behind your other leg and towards the original side. If done quickly you can fool the defender to one side and go the other. Because it is not a dynamic move, you need to be sure you can fool the defender. You can't readjust after deciding to perform  this move. If the defender is clever, they will just steal the ball as you have no other options. |      |

As the ball moves to the inside towards the weak side of the body, the same foot is used  to go on the inside to outside of the ball (around the front of the ball)  This fakes out the defender by making them believe the dribbler is going  the strong way, while in reality the ball is rolling to the weak side.

## In the begning it will be a productivity first tool, then a game SHOULD be made with TikiTaka:

- An ***element*** is defined as a buffer, stream, or file
- Moving data (the ball) from one element to the other with protections is a ***pass***
- Moving data (the ball) from one element to the other without protections is considered a ***shot***
- ***Bad pass or shot*** is when you lose the ball to the other team. (only if your playing against someone) 
- ***A Miss*** can be mitigated with subsequent behavior to further your objectives. It means an exception was not thrown because you knew how to use mitigators.
- A ***Dribble move*** is a filter on a buffer, before a shot or pass.
- A ***touch*** is an essential element to making sure you don't miss on the pass or the shot. 
  - Buf if you take good touches, you can set yourself up for style points on subsequent shots and passes, that come much later 
    - (which add up to moral victories and real secondary points)
- ***Vertical***  passes and shots are determined by what depth in your file tree you pass or shoot to.
- ***Horizontal*** passes (left or right) are done at the same level in your file tree. If you want to do a long cross you have to specifiy a location in your file tree that is at the same tree depth.  If you don't meet this criteria its a miss (which can be mitigated), but is not considered losing the ball. Losing the ball requires that it go out of bounds (exception), or that you are playing against someone (which is a miss against an oppnent).
