var LOG_SONG = `What rolls down stairs
Alone or in pairs,
And over your neighbor's dog?
What's great for a snack,
And fits on your back?
It's log! log! log!

It's looooog, it's looooog,
It's big, it's heavy, it's wood.
It's looooog, it's looooog, 
it's better than bad, it's good.

Everyone wants a log!
You're gonna love this log!
Come on and get your log!
Everyone needs this log!
Log! log! log!`
